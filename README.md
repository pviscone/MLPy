A Multi Layer Perceptron library and other tools like some preprocessing tools, a non linear least square regressor (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) and an ensembler.
To imporove the performances library like Numba and Joblib was used to exploit just in time compilation and parallelization (for the grid search)

Training and results are in docs/Notebook and the data provided by the professor is in /data
